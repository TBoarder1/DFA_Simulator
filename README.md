# DFA_Simulator
-# DFA
 -Deterministic Finite Automaton simulator written in C++
 -
 -Program uses a menu interface and makes the user create any two letter alphabet that they want, with error checking to make certain that the same character is not picked twice.
 
 -Once the alphabet is entered, it asks you to enter a string using your two letter alphabet.
 
 -Then it runs through the program, outputting each step through the DFA or DFA-Complement arrays before Accepting or Not Accepting at the end.  If a character that was not in your alphabet was entered into the string, it lets you know and makes you start over.
